# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is part of a huge course I'm doing to get deeper in basic and new concepts related to React.
this initial part is a about the general knowledge everyone should have (except firebase), in the next commits I'll go deeper 
in concepts like redux, saga and patterns.

I personally, recommended the courses from ZTM. Don't miss them.
